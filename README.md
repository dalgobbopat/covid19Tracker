# covid19Tracker

Using ReactJS, JavaScript, API calls,  CSS, and Materila UI I am building a Front End project that visualizes COVID-19 through cards showing number of deaths, recovered, and how many cases are around. You can filter through countries, or worklwide as well as seeing a line graph on daily numbers and a map showing how it has impacted each country.
